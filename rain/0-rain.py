def rain(walls):
    """
    Calculate the amount of rainwater retained between walls represented as a relief map.

    Parameters:
    - walls (list): A list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1.

    Returns:
    - Integer: The total amount of rainwater retained.

    Functionality:
    - The walls list represents the cross-section of a relief map, where each integer represents the height of a wall with unit width 1.
    - The ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not considered as walls and will not retain water.
    - If the list is empty, the function returns 0.
